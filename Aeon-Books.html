      Effective date: <strong>2025-12-14</strong>

  <p>
    Aeon Book ("the App") is a reading application for public-domain literary works.
    The App may include the original Japanese text (e.g., from Aozora Bunko), a modern Japanese rendering, and an English version for reading and learning purposes.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <strong>Summary:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>No account registration is required.</li>
      <li>The App does not ask you to provide your name, email address, phone number, or precise location.</li>
      <li>The App may display ads. Advertising partners may collect limited device or usage data under their own privacy policies.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not provide user login, account creation, or user profiling features.
    The App does not ask you to submit personal information such as your name, address, phone number, email address, contacts, precise location, or payment details.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not operate user accounts and we do not maintain a user profile database.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Public-Domain Content</h2>
  <p>
    The App presents public-domain literary texts and related reading materials. Some texts may be sourced from publicly available public-domain repositories (for example, Aozora Bunko).
  </p>
  <p>
    The modern Japanese rendering and/or English text may be provided to support comprehension and learning.
    The App does not request users to upload content.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    The App may display advertisements. Ads may be provided by third-party advertising services.
    Depending on the ad service configuration, these partners may collect certain information (for example, device identifiers, approximate location, ad interactions, or diagnostics) to deliver, limit, and measure ads.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not receive personal details like your name or email address from ad providers. We may receive aggregated or non-identifying reports (for example, ad performance statistics) when offered by the provider.
    Data handling by third-party providers is governed by each provider’s privacy policy.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
  <p>
    The App itself does not use browser cookies. However, third-party advertising SDKs may use technologies such as device identifiers or similar mechanisms to provide ad-related functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is intended for a general audience and is not designed to knowingly collect personal information from children.
    If you believe a child has provided personal information through the App, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect the App and its distribution. Since the App does not store personal information on our servers, there is no user account database to secure.
    Third-party advertising partners are responsible for protecting any data they collect under their policies.
  </p>

  <h2>7. International Users</h2>
  <p>
    If you use the App outside your country, third-party service providers (such as ad partners) may process data in other jurisdictions in accordance with their policies and applicable law.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page by updating the effective date.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>

      Actual data usage may vary depending on the advertising SDK configuration and your device settings.
